This repository is the result of my journey into building a dynamic backend using Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL.

## Importing the Database
Make sure the MySQL service is running.
Use the following command to import the database:
```agsl
mysql -u root -p < src/main/resources/backup.sql
```
Replace root with your MySQL username if it's different.
